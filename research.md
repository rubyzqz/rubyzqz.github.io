Below you'll find explanations on how to create a site just like this and get it hosted
  for free. 

<!-- # COMMENT EXPLAINING THIS PAGE -- 
We're currently using this section of the site to host these tutorials,
  but you might want to use it to showcase and describe your `Research`,
  to chronicle various `Talks` you've given over your history, or to
  write about various news or updates that have happened to you.

You can update the `title` of file (line 3) to change the heading of 
  the page and its title in the browser. To change how it's referred to
  in the navigation and/or adjust its url, see `data/navigation.yml` file.

## Improvised Storytelling Project

This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by 
  [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).
  The original project, called [`jekyll academic`](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/)
  has its own [github repository](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic)
  and [workshop documentation](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/). 


## Prosodic Adaptation Project


To see a step-by-step guide to build your own site, go to the [RESEARCH](/research) section. 
  There you'll find a basic [guide](/blog/getting-started) that will help you
  create your new site.

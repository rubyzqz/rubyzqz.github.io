Below you'll find explanations on how to create a site just like this and get it hosted
  for free. 


### Improvised Storytelling Project

This project is a slight customization based off of some great work by 
  [NC State University Libraries](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/).
  The original project, called [`jekyll academic`](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/)
  has its own [github repository](https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/jekyll-academic)
  and [workshop documentation](https://ncsu-libraries.github.io/jekyll-academic-docs/workshop/). 


### Prosodic Adaptation Project


To see a step-by-step guide to build your own site, go to the [RESEARCH](/research) section. 
  There you'll find a basic [guide](/blog/getting-started) that will help you
  create your new site.

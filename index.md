excerpt: "About Me..."
---

Hello! I go by either Ruby or Qingzhi (see this wonderful [demo](https://www.chinesenamesinenglish.com/wiki/Qingzhi) for how to pronounce it). I’m from Shenzhen, China, and I use she/her/hers pronouns.

I’m a graduate student working with [Dr. Elise Piazza](https://www.piazzalab.com/) at the University of Rochester. I received B.A. in Psychology and Music in 2020 from Bryn Mawr College. I’m curious about human minds and how individuals interact with one another, especially through the medium of sound. In my graduate studies, I hope to explore the role of improvisation as a means of communication and a type of creativity in interpersonal interaction, musically and linguistically, among adults and children. Currently, I’m using computational and behavioral methods to examine creativity in people’s improvised storytelling (project 1) and how people’s prosody adapts to one another during a conversation (project 2). Please go to the [RESEARCH](/research) section for more details.

Outside of academia, I love playing the violin in large ensembles and singing in the car. I also enjoy journaling, doing workouts, trying new recipes, and massaging my cat at home.

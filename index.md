excerpt: "About Me..."

Hello! I am Qingzhi (see this wonderful [demo](https://www.chinesenamesinenglish.com/wiki/Qingzhi) for how to pronounce it) and I also go by Ruby. I grew up in Shenzhen, China, and I use she/her/hers pronouns.

I am a graduate student working with [Dr. Elise Piazza](https://www.piazzalab.com/) at the University of Rochester. I received my B.A. in Psychology and Music in 2020 from Bryn Mawr College. I am curious about human minds and how individuals interact with one another, especially through the medium of sound. In my graduate studies, I hope to explore the role of improvisation as a means of communication and a type of creativity in interpersonal interaction, musically and linguistically, among adults and children. Currently, I use computational and behavioral methods to examine naturalistic speech production. In the [Improvised Storytelling Study](/research), I aim to capture semantic creativity in people’s improvised narratives. In the [Prosodic Adaptation Study](/research), I look at how people’s prosody adapt to one another when they agree or disagree on certain social topics. Please go to the [RESEARCH](/research) section for more details.

Outside of academia, I love playing the violin in large ensembles and singing in the car. I also enjoy writing journals, doing workouts, trying new recipes, and massaging my cat at home.
